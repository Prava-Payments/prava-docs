Prava is currently available by request only (invite/sandbox access). This lets us onboard you with the correct environment, credentials, and merchant settings.

## How to request access

1.  **Click Request Access**
2.  **Fill the access form** with your company name, contact email, use case, and whether you are requesting sandbox or production access.
3.  We will review your request and respond within 24 hours with your sandbox credentials and next steps.

## What youâ€™ll receive after approval

*   Sandbox API key and base URLs
*   Links to SDK packages and sample apps
*   Access to the API Reference and developer dashboard (if applicable)
*   Onboarding checklist and sandbox test accounts

<Note>
  Production access requires additional verification (merchant agreements, KYC/KYB) and will be handled after sandbox validation.
