## What Prava Solves

Traditional online checkout requires manual user input. AI apps can help with search and recommendation, but they can’t complete payments without:

- Secure access to card credentials
- Verified user intent
- Trust between agents and merchants
- A standard way to deliver payment payloads

Prava provides these foundations so AI agents can pay on behalf of users safely.

## 2. Core Concepts

These are the major pieces developers should understand:

### 1. Agent Identity

Every AI agent interacting with merchants must be identifiable and trusted.
Prava issues the agent a secure identity, enabling merchants to validate who is making the request.

### 2. Tokenized Card Credentials

Users never expose real card numbers to the agent.
Prava converts every card into a one time use card that is:

- Bound to the user
- Bound to the agent
- Bound to the particular merchant & product
- Controlled with user authentication
- Protected against misuse

### 3. User Intent

Before an agent can pay, the user must define what the agent is allowed to buy — e.g.:

- Item details
- Budget
- Quantity
- When the purchase can occur (immediately or automated later)

Prava bundles this into a structured Intent Object.

### 4. Merchant Verification

Agents must ensure they are transacting with legitimate merchants.
Prava provides merchant validation so payments aren’t made to spoofed or unsafe sites.

### 5. Checkout Payloads

Prava generates a secure, one-time payment payload that the agent sends to the merchant.
This works across:

- Regular merchant checkout pages (form-fill) 
    - These merchants don't need integration with Prava
- Merchant APIs (agent-friendly checkout)

## 3. How It Works — High-Level Flow

1. **User Adds a Card**
   The app collects card details → sends to Prava → Prava returns a secure token.

2. **User Verifies Identity**
   The user authenticates once (passkey or MFA).
   After this, the card can be used safely by the agent.

3. **Agent Builds Intent**
   The app/agent browses, compares, and builds a final order.

4. **User Confirms (or Pre-Approves Automation)**
   The Intent Object is finalized.

5. **Prava Registers Intent + Generates Checkout Payload**
   Includes all necessary security checks.

6. **Agent Completes Checkout**
   - For simple merchants → agent fills the payment fields securely
   - For advanced merchants → agent sends a checkout API call

7. **Transaction Processes Normally**
   Merchant → Acquirer → Card Network → Issuer → Response returned

8. **Agent + App Receive Final Status**

This entire flow is handled through Prava’s SDK.

## 4. Integration Options

### A. Full Prava Agentic SDK (Recommended)

Handles tokenization, authentication, intent, merchant validation, checkout payloads, and form-fill.

You only need simple calls like:

```javascript
const intent = await prava.intent.create(order);
const result = await prava.checkout.execute(intent);
```

### B. API-Only Integration

For teams who want to build flows manually and call individual endpoints (tokenization, intent, checkout generation, etc.).

## 5. Getting Access — Onboarding Process

Prava is currently in restricted rollout due to the compliance & security requirements of agentic payments.

To get access:

1. **Fill the onboarding form**
   - Whether you're an AI app or a merchant, provide basic details
   - Choose your integration mode (SDK / API / Merchant)

2. **Prava reviews your request**
   This includes trust verification & intended use checks.

3. **Access within 24 hours**
   - API keys
   - Sandbox environment
   - Developer dashboard
   - Integration instructions
   - Support channel

4. **Go live once your flows pass automated validation checks**

This ensures developers can build confidently while protecting users and merchants.

## 6. Where This Works

Prava supports:

- Any AI application (shopping agent, personal assistant, travel planner, automation bot, etc.)
- Any merchant (no-code, low-code, or agentic-first)
- Any standard online card checkout flow

Agents can seamlessly complete purchases without breaking existing merchant experiences.

## 7. Why Developers Use Prava

- No payments expertise needed
- No sensitive card data exposure
- Works across all merchants
- Fast integration via a single SDK
- Future-proof infrastructure aligned with global payment standards
- Great user experience (instant, secure agentic checkout)
