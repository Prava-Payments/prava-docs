## Wallets

Isolated containers that hold balance metadata and enforcement rules. Wallets enable:

*   Per-agent permissions
*   Spending caps and rate limits
*   Transaction-level approvals

## Guardrails & Evals

*   **Guardrails** are rule-based controls (spending caps, merchant blacklists, currency restrictions).
*   **Evals** are evaluation prompts/rules that validate natural-language instructions against user settings (for example, checking whether “buy shoes under $100” matches user limits).

## Payments

The payment lifecycle includes creation, authorization, capture, settlement, and refunds. Prava handles tokenization and network routing for agentic flows.

## Merchant Network & Shopify App

Prava integrates with merchant platforms (a Shopify plugin is available by invite-only) and card networks to complete payments while preserving merchant-of-record (MoR) semantics where applicable.
