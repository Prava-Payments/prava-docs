## Shopify App & SDK

The Prava Shopify app is live but available by **invite only**. Merchants who want to enable Prava for their stores must request access.

To request Shopify onboarding, merchants should complete the merchant onboarding form (replace with merchant form URL). After verification, weâ€™ll enable the merchant and provide onboarding instructions.

## Shopify Merchant Flow

1.  **Request Onboarding**: The merchant requests onboarding.
2.  **Verification**: The Prava team verifies the merchant.
3.  **Provisioning**: Prava provisions tokenization and routing for the merchant (no extra checkout required).
4.  **Fulfillment**: Orders triggered by AI agents are sent to the merchant's order system for fulfillment.
