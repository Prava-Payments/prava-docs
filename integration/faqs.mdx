## Merchant FAQs & Concerns

**Q: Do merchants need to change their checkout?**

A: No. Prava tokenizes payments and routes them to the merchant through existing card/acquirer flows. Where applicable, a small webhook integration or plugin (like the Shopify app) will deliver order details for fulfillment.

**Q: Who is the merchant-of-record (MoR)?**

A: This depends on your integration and contract. Prava supports multiple settlement models and will confirm MoR details during merchant onboarding.

**Q: What about refunds and disputes?**

A: Refunds follow standard refund flows. Prava exposes refund endpoints, and merchants or platforms can issue refunds through the API. Disputes are routed to the responsible parties as per your settlement agreement.
