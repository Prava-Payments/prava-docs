## Shopify App & SDK

The Prava Shopify app is live but available by **invite only**. Merchants who want to enable Prava for their stores must request access.

To request Shopify onboarding, merchants should complete the merchant onboarding form (replace with merchant form URL). After verification, weâ€™ll enable the merchant and provide onboarding instructions.

## Shopify Merchant Flow

1.  **Request Onboarding**: The merchant requests onboarding.
2.  **Verification**: The Prava team verifies the merchant.
3.  **Provisioning**: Prava provisions tokenization and routing for the merchant (no extra checkout required).
4.  **Fulfillment**: Orders triggered by AI agents are sent to the merchant's order system for fulfillment.

## Merchant FAQs & Concerns

**Q: Do merchants need to change their checkout?**

A: No. Prava tokenizes payments and routes them to the merchant through existing card/acquirer flows. Where applicable, a small webhook integration or plugin (like the Shopify app) will deliver order details for fulfillment.

**Q: Who is the merchant-of-record (MoR)?**

A: This depends on your integration and contract. Prava supports multiple settlement models and will confirm MoR details during merchant onboarding.

**Q: What about refunds and disputes?**

A: Refunds follow standard refund flows. Prava exposes refund endpoints, and merchants or platforms can issue refunds through the API. Disputes are routed to the responsible parties as per your settlement agreement.
