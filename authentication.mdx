## Authentication

Prava uses bearer tokens to authenticate requests.

*   Include the `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>` header on every request.
*   Keep your tokens secret and secure.
*   Rotate tokens if they are compromised.

## Environments

*   **Sandbox** — For development and testing. Use the sandbox base URL and sandbox keys.
*   **Production** — Provisioned after additional verification. Production keys will be issued separately.

## Webhooks

Prava supports webhooks for asynchronous status updates (e.g., payments, disputes, wallet events).

*   Verify webhook signatures using the SDK helper or the header signature provided on each event to ensure security.
