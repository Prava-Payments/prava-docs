## Components

*   **AI Agent** — The LLM or app that initiates a purchase on behalf of a user.
*   **Prava API / SDK** — RESTful endpoints and SDK wrappers used by your app/server to interact with Prava.
*   **Customer** — The end user that owns funds and wallets.
*   **Wallet** — A secure balance container for a customer. Wallets include policies and spending caps.
*   **Guardrails Engine** — A validation & intent system that verifies natural-language intent, rules, and thresholds.
*   **Payment Network & Merchant** — The underlying card networks and merchant endpoints used to settle transactions.

## High-Level Flow

1.  A user instructs an AI agent to buy an item.
2.  The agent sends a purchase intent to your backend.
3.  Your backend calls Prava APIs (create customer → create wallet → validate intent → create payment).
4.  Prava applies guardrails, tokenizes the payment, routes it through the networks, and returns the status.
5.  Your app displays a confirmation to the user and persists the transaction data.
